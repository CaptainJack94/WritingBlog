# WritingBlog
Blog project for short stories
This is a project for a blog site where I'll host my own short stories which will be around British history
I'll design the project from scratch using sketching tools and Figma to wireframe
I'll then build the site using HTML, CSS and Javascript
I'll then host the site on Microsoft Azure to gain experience in this area
