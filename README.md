# WritingBlog
This is a project to build a simple web application where I'll host short stories about British history which I'll be writing myself. 
I want to use this opportunity to get experience with design & UX principles along with building an application using HTML, CSS & Boostrap and Javascript.
I want to gain experience with Github actions & pipelines.
I'll then host the site on Microsoft Azure to gain experience in this area
Please see my Wiki for a journal of how I'm getting on.
