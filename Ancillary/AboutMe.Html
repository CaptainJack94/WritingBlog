          Hi, thanks for stopping by! My name's Jack and I'm an application support engineer from Derbyshire, UK specializing in support for SAAS platforms.
          I've worked across web and mobile applications both cloud native and on premise across multiple tech stacks including Java/Oracle and .NET
          I also have experience working with T-SQL and PL-SQL in commercial businesses on both SQL server and Oracle databases.
          I have a particular interest in cloud technology and have previously worked in the Microsoft Azure portal to monitor and run scripts on virtual machines running production workloads.
          <br>
          I'm passionate about progressing my career by specializing in DevOps and want to gain more experience working on cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure) and I built this web application principally with this in mind, I'm using Github to store the project and Microsoft Azure to host the application.
          I bring a curious and teamwork focused approach to my work, I love to engage with customers to find out root cause problems and identify the best solution moving forwards.
          I really enjoy working as part of a customer focused team and pride myself on going the extra mile for both my team and customers.

            I've always had an interest in history and want to use this opportunity to write short stories about different, maybe less well known parts of British history that are ripe for a good yarn.
            My first story <em>Beneath the Blazing Sun</em> tells the story of two young brothers who set out on the First Crusade and covers the arc of this pivotal moment in European and Middle-Eastern history.
            My inspiration for writing comes from reading <em>Wilbur Smith's Courtney series</em> I found the theme of family and exploration over the Age of Discovery really hooked me and made me want to write my own yarn.

            In my spare time, when not writing I'm a recruit in the Royal Naval Reserve currently going through phase one initial training, I'm hoping to specialize in IT further down the line.
            I also practice Wado Ryu style Karate at my local club in Derbyshire.
